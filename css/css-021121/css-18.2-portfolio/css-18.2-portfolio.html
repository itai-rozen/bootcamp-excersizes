                In West Philadelphia born and raised
                On the playground is where I spent most of my days
                Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
                And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
                When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                <span class="only-widescreen">
                    Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                    And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
                    I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                    But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
                    She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
                    I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"
                    First class, yo, this is bad
                    Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
                    Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
                    Hmm, this might be all right
                    But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
                    Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
                    I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
                    I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air.
